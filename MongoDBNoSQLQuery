/ In this project, we will querying data in MongoDB. The first set of queries will be dealing with 
ratings of recipes online, and the second set of queries will be analyzing twitter data.

/ In the cooker database, find the 4 highest average rated recipes, and return the title and the rating average.

cooker> db.recipes.find({}, {"title" : 1, "rating_avg" : 1}).sort({"rating_avg" : -1}).limit(4);

/ Find the 4 highest average rated mexican recipes, and return the title, tags and rating average for the recipes.

cooker> db.recipes.find({"tags": "mexican"}, {"title" : 1, "tags" : 1, "rating_avg" : 1}).sort({"rating_avg" : -1}).limit(4);

/ Find the recipes liked by user ID 1, sorted by title, and show the title of the recipe and the list of users that liked it

cooker> db.recipes.find({"likes" : {$all : [1]}}, {"title :1, "likes" : 1}).sort({"title" : 1});

/ Now moving on to the twitter data, find the total number of tweets liked by the user "sarah"

twitter_db> db.tweets.countDocuments({"user.name" : "sarah"});

/ Retrieve the 3 latest tweets that were replying to the user with the user.screen_name “globeandmail”
/ Include 4 fields: _id, the.user.screen_name of each replyer, time of the reply, and text of the replies.

twitter_db> db.tweets.find({"in_reply_to_screen_name" : 'globeandmail'}, {"created_at" : 1, "user.screen_name" : 1, "text" :1}).sort({created_at : -1}).limit(3);

/ Retrieve top 5 users that have twitted the most. Include their username, and the total number of tweets posted by each of them

twitter_db> db.results.aggregate([{$group : {_id : '$user.id', username: {$first: "$user.name"}, totaltweets: {$sum: 1}}}, {$sort: {totaltweets : -1}}, {$limit : 5}]);
